# Citation Map

This document maps the summarized references to specific sections of the paper (`paper.tex`), defining their purpose and categorization.

## Citation Categories

*   **Foundational Theory:** Core theoretical frameworks (Game Theory, IO) that underpin the model.
*   **Empirical Support:** Studies providing data, case studies, or stylized facts that validate the empirical observations.
*   **Methodological Justification:** Literature justifying the specific methods (EDA, Q-learning, specific game formulations) used.
